# Introduction
The goal of this experimental setup is to cheaply and reliably measure the index of refraction of a target material.
The strategy is to use a cube (rectangular prisms are enough) of the target material, and trigonometry so that we don't have to measure angles.
It sounds like the standard strategies for computing index of refraction do it by measuring angles.
That sounds faster, but more error prone with low quality equipment.

# Preliminaries:

# Needed Materials:
1) Target material rectangular prism.
2) A sufficiently flat surface.
3) A sufficiently narrow laser pointer.
4) Paper.
5) Writing instrument.
6) Calipers
# Experimental Loop:
1) Place Paper on flat surface
2) Setup laser over paper.
3) Place prism in the path of the laser.
4) Mark the 2 corners of the prism onto paper as F, B. Mark the corners which are on the opposite side from the direction the laser is bending. Let F be on the side of the prism where the laser enters the glass, and B on the other side.
5) Mark the planar location of the laser entering and exiting the prism as E and X respectively.
6) Emphasize the XB line.
7) Remove the prism from the surface without shifting the paper. (paper weights suggested)
8) Mark where the laser crosses XB line Y.
9) Measure FE, XB, YB, EX, EY as precisely as possible.
10) Compute z = (FE -YB)/EY and record it for this trial
11) Compute y = (FE -XB)/EX and record it for this trial.
# Analysis:
The index of refraction between the air and target material should be computed as a linear regression z = k*y we want k. 
# Explanation
This method avoids measuring angles and taking sines by measuring the corresponding sine. More measurements, should lead to more precision with this method.
