# ResinLenses
## GOAL A: Testing whether lenses can be orthogonally decomposed.
So the main author is under the current impression that two cylindrical lenses 90 degrees out of phase would be equivalent to a single spherical lens. (ignoring thin flat lens effects)
The experimental question is " in a VR or optometry setting are the thin lens effects significant? "
### GOAL A2:
The second question is "are these thin lens effects more relevant than any removed effect from using an ideal lense instead of a spherical lens"
## GOAL B: With minimal labour costs, can you Resin-3D print Cylindricalesque lenses
The one hackaday item I found on printing lenses mentioned a lot of sanding.
I would suspect that print layers cause significant problems.
This might be somewhat avoidable if there is no variation between layers like in a cylindrical lens.
## Deliverable 1 : cheap prescription glasses
3D resin printed glasses service using print on demand as an option, or a printed files option.
## Deliverable 2: High fov Google cardboard class headset
While this could in principle use 3d printed lenses, they aren't necessary...
## Deliverable 3: DIY class headset
???
