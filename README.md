# ResinLenses
## GOAL 1: Testing whether lenses can be orthogonally decomposed.
So the main author is under the current impression that two cylindrical lenses 90 degrees out of phase would be equivalent to a single spherical lens. (ignoring thin flat lens effects)
The experimental question is " in a VR or optometry setting are the thin lens effects significant? "
The second question is "are these thin lens effects more relevant than any removed effect from using an ideal lense instead of a spherical lens"
