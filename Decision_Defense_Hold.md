# Why was this project on hold:
1. Lack of expertise in optics
2. Lack of funds for core machinery
3. Lack of tight relevance to dance
# Why this project isn't cancelled or deleted:
1. Lenses are a core part of the HIGH COST of any VR device.
2. The idea of orthoganal decomposition seems worth at least getting a failed test for.
# Why this project was restarted:
1. Alternative options for core machinery (laser cutting or other machining) which are available at libraries.
